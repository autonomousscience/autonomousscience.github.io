                Scientific discovery is rapidly evolving through the integration of artificial intelligence, robotics,
                and autonomous systems. However, many autonomous laboratories still operate in isolation, limiting
                collaboration and slowing progress. This roadmap outlines a community-driven strategy to connect
                capabilities across institutions, standardize interfaces for interoperability, and enable intelligent
                orchestration of experiments and data. It identifies critical dimensions for building a cohesive
                national infrastructure that supports distributed, automated, and reproducible science. The goal is to
                accelerate the pace of discovery while expanding access to advanced scientific tools and methods.

                <h4>Instrument and Cyberinfrastructure Integration</h4>
                <p>Interconnecting autonomous laboratories requires agents to operate diverse scientific instruments and
                    computational resources across institutional boundaries. This integration supports seamless
                    workflows from data collection to analysis, enabling rapid, reproducible scientific discovery. Key
                    challenges include heterogeneity of instruments, lack of standardized interfaces, and coordination
                    of distributed resources.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>M1.</strong> Establish common integration interfaces for scientific instruments with
                        vendor-agnostic hardware abstraction layers and API development via an Instrument API
                        Consortium.</li>
                    <li><strong>M2.</strong> Demonstrate end-to-end autonomous workflows across institutions for
                        seamless experimental and computational resource orchestration through secure multi-domain
                        cyberinfrastructure networks.</li>
                    <li><strong>M3.</strong> Deploy federated cyberinfrastructure with standardized frameworks,
                        fault-tolerant coordination mechanisms, and adaptive resource management with zero-trust
                        security and physics-aware digital twins for workflow validation.</li>
                    <li><strong>M4.</strong> Develop a scalable national framework supporting heterogeneous instruments
                        for near real-time data flows with self-describing instruments, automated calibration, and

                <h4>Agent-Driven Data Management</h4>
                <p>This approach shifts from passive data storage to intelligent systems where autonomous agents manage
                    the full data lifecycle. Agents curate, validate, and share data across facilities while enforcing
                    FAIR principles. Key challenges include schema variability, data quality assurance, privacy
                    concerns, and the need for real-time processing.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>M5.</strong> Develop AI-driven metadata systems with automated annotation of
                        experimental data in multiple domains, achieving high accuracy without human intervention.</li>
                    <li><strong>M6.</strong> Deploy federated data mesh architecture with common APIs,
                        cross-institutional discovery capabilities, and autonomous FAIR data governance.</li>
                    <li><strong>M7.</strong> Implement near real-time data processing infrastructure supporting
                        high-velocity scientific streams with automated quality assessment, provenance tracking, and
                        regulatory compliance frameworks.</li>

                <h4>AI Agent-Driven Autonomous Orchestration</h4>
                <p>Intelligent agents coordinate experimental decisions using AI methods grounded in scientific
                    knowledge. These agents integrate domain expertise, real-time data, and model-based reasoning to
                    plan and execute workflows. Challenges include the probabilistic nature of AI models, ensuring
                    scientific validity, and orchestrating across distributed, asynchronous systems.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>M8.</strong> Demonstrate hierarchical architectures in which LLM agents orchestrate
                        traditional methods through domain-specific scientific interfaces, achieving significant
                        speedups and experimental accuracy.</li>

                <h4>Interoperable Agent Communication Interfaces and Standards</h4>
                <p>To enable coordination between agents across institutions, standardized communication protocols are
                    essential. These interfaces support asynchronous, secure, and fault-tolerant messaging while
                    ensuring semantic interoperability across domains. Key challenges include diverse instrument
                    protocols, security requirements, and reliable coordination at scale.</p>

                        service registries, enabling dynamic reconfiguration and capability negotiation in
                        geographically distributed facilities.</li>

                <h4>Education and Workforce Development</h4>
                <p>Preparing the next generation of scientists to work with autonomous systems requires rethinking
                    education. Training must integrate AI and robotics with core scientific skills and emphasize
                    human-AI collaboration, ethical reasoning, and system oversight. Key challenges include curriculum
                    development, faculty expertise, and equitable access to hands-on learning.</p>
